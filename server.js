Based on the SAMA Cyber Security Framework, several of the MASAR ALNUMOU FINANCE policies should be classified as **standards** rather than policies. This distinction is crucial because standards provide more specific and technical guidance on how to implement security controls, while policies focus on high-level principles and objectives.\n\nHere are the policies that should be reclassified as standards, according to the SAMA framework:\n\n1. **Application Security Standard:**  This document already uses the term \"standard\" in its title, and its content aligns with the concept of a standard. It provides detailed guidance on secure coding practices, input validation, output sanitization, and other technical controls for application security.\n\n2. **Cryptographic Security Policy:**  This policy outlines specific cryptographic algorithms, key management practices, and other technical details. It should be reclassified as a \"Cryptographic Security Standard\" to reflect its focus on technical implementation.\n\n3. **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy:** The SAMA framework refers to \"BYOD Standard\" (3.3.10). Therefore, renaming this policy to \"Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Standard\" would ensure consistency with the framework terminology. \n\n4. **Event Management Policy:**  While this policy defines a high-level event management process, its focus on technical aspects like SIEM configuration, vulnerability management, and incident response procedures makes it more suitable as an \"Event Management Standard.\"\n\n**Rationale for Reclassification:**\n\n* **Specificity:** Standards delve into the technical details of implementing security controls, providing specific instructions and configurations. The policies listed above exhibit this characteristic.\n* **Implementation Focus:** Standards are primarily concerned with the \"how\" of security, outlining the practical steps for implementing security controls. \n* **Framework Alignment:** Reclassifying these policies as standards aligns them more closely with the SAMA framework's terminology and emphasis on technical implementation.\n\n**Benefits of Reclassification:**\n\n* **Improved Clarity:**  Distinguishing between policies and standards provides a clearer understanding of the organization's security framework.\n* **Enhanced Compliance:**  Aligning with the SAMA framework's terminology demonstrates a commitment to meeting regulatory requirements.\n* **Effective Implementation:**  Standards provide more actionable guidance for IT and security teams, facilitating the implementation of security controls.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Review the content of the policies mentioned above and make any necessary adjustments to solidify their focus on technical implementation.\n* Update the titles of these policies to reflect their reclassification as standards.\n* Communicate the changes to all relevant stakeholders and provide training on the updated terminology and framework.\n\nBy clearly differentiating between policies and standards, MASAR ALNUMOU FINANCE can streamline its security framework, improve implementation effectiveness, and enhance its overall cybersecurity posture. \n"},
